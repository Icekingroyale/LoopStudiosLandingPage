## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid


### What I learned

I learnt about the usage of the tag '<figcaption>'

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:



```html
<figure>
  <img src='' alt='' />
  <figcaption> Image caption </figcaption>
</figure>
```

I learnt about using CSS variable
```css
:root {
  --primary-color: papayawhip;
}

@media screen and (max-width: 400ps){
  .nav{
    display: flex;
  }
}

```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```


### Continued development

For continues development I will be intrested in learning.
1. CSS Animation and @keyframe
2. CSS Advance Selectors
3. Unknown tags
4. CSS grid
5. JavaScript
